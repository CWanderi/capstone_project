# Geospatioal imaging for crop suitability

## Objectives
* Identify and visualize regions best suited for specific crops based on weather history, soil texture, and land conditions
* Create predictive models to estimate crop suitability using long-term weather patterns and degradation indicators
* Deploy a web app and chatbot that gives planting recommendations suited to a user's location
  
## About this project:
This project helps farmers and planners in Kenya decide which crops to grow and where to plant them. It uses satellite images and soil data from the Kenya Space Agency to find the best areas for farming. The tool looks at things like how healthy the land is (using NDVI), what kind of soil is there, and weather history to give smart recommendations.

## Impact
Our model assists farmers and decision-makers with key information, making agricultural planning more resilient to climate shifts,soil and weather history.
